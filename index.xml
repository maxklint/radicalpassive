      <description>Radical Passive is an architectural group formed in 2019 with offices in Minsk and Brussels. We create new architecture of public spaces, buildings, interiors and furniture elements, we develop projects of renovation and reconstruction. Our works are free to speak their own language, without excess meaning but radically aimed at evoking feelings.</description>

      <description>Melancholy space
Melancholy is a form of mental illness manifested in a prolonged state of sadness. Characteristic for melancholy is a solemn and pensive mood, often the result of a more thoughtful view on life. In small doses it is a defence reaction of the psyche, a restorative slumber bringing rebirth.
Postmodernism created an environment brimming with signs and meanings. This obscures the distinction between essential and secondary. An apartment leaves you alone with yourself, lets you escape the belarusian reality.</description>

      <description>“Touchable distance” Exhibition design
The unequivocal times we’re currently facing have entailed an abrupt change in the ways we interact with each other, and our perception of the surrounding world. This shift in our form of communication has not only led to societal frustration, but also pushed us to rethink familiar concepts. Daily life and human behavior have significantly changed with a sense of increased fear and anxiety. Breaking away from our physical connections, in the most basic sense, we are forced to seek interaction online.</description>

      <title>Minsk Light Industry Accessory Factory. Facade renovation</title>

      <description>Minsk Light Industry Accessory Factory. Facade renovation
The building of a former accessories factory is located in the central part of Minsk and dates back to the 1950s. It is a typical example of functionalism in soviet architecture.
The new owner wants to transform the empty building into a business hub where IT-companies coexist with educational establishments and cultural institutions. We were asked to adapt the run-down facades for the new function.</description>

      <description>Labor and leisure club
Located in Minsk and built around the 1950s, the building represents a typical example of soviet architecture. To include it in the modern economical and cultural contexts while preserving its architectural identity was the leading motive of the project.
The building is a legacy of the soviet industrial architecture of the mid 20th century. The combination of red walls with white window frames and decor was one of the characteristic features of industrial buildings of that time.</description>

      <description>Steel frame armchair
The armchair is developed for a private space. Rigorous design, inspired by furniture of the Modernist era, is conveyed by the simplicity of form and the choice of materials. The frame is made of stainless steel, the seat is upholstered with a rough dark fabric. The design by Radical Passive was realised in collaboration with two Belarusian manufactures.

      <description>Useless tree
At one time Alexander Brodsky used to take photos of old garages, while John Pawson - of the sky. Both saw in it architectural value, albeit this value was personal. Perhaps if one wants to learn how to create simple and comprehensible design, first one has to learn to see beauty in the mundane, to understand the nature of these simple things: how the owners of those garages adapted the standard soviet structure to their needs or how atmospheric pollution in different regions changes the colour of sky.</description>
