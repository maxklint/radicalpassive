      <description>Living block in Minsk. Concept
This project was initially designed for the development of the land lot in the city center. But due to the economic problems the development was canceled and our team transformed the project into a universal solution suitable for developing residential areas within European urban context.
The block is formed by three different types of residential buildings (tower, section building and urban villa) located along its perimeter.</description>

      <description>White candle holder
We have a tradition of dedicating a candle holder to each client that we work with and giving it to them as a present at the end of the project. So, the object is designed with a particular person or couple in mind and can be placed in the interior that we designed for them.

A big enveloping cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s bigger than a normal chair: its dimensions defy common standards. You don&amp;rsquo;t sit on this chair, you stay in it. Furthermore, sitting in the chair is just one of the possible poses. Its soft, rounded shape gives it a relaxed and stable character. The upholstery is made of white textured corduroy.
The chair is inspired by the works of the French studio Pierre Augustin Rose and the Russian designer Olga Engel.</description>

The chair is on the border between a functional object and a sculpture. It was specifically designed to stand out in the interior. It has no backrest, making it more of a cushioned stool. The armrests flow smoothly from the shape of the seat. The solid base gives the entire structure stability. The distinctive shape is accentuated by the black velour upholstery.
The chair is inspired by the works of the French studio Pierre Augustin Rose and the Russian designer Olga Engel.</description>

      <description>Wooden bench
The lightweight construction and compact size of the bench make it a convenient and practical piece of interior design. The intentionally primitive design is not an accent, but rather an addition to the interior. The uncomplicated light silhouette adds detail to the space while the wood adds materiality.

      <description>Театр
Этот проект не имеет отношения к реальному проектированию. Его итогом не стали привлекательные визуализации фасадов и альбомы чертежей с материалами и конструктивными узлами.
Это наш поиск подходящей архитектурной типологии театра, где зритель немного ближе к актерам, а актеры немного свободнее в выборе материала и его подачи. Наше небольшое размышление над тем, как здание может стать более открытым к диалогу и взаимодействию артиста и зрителя. Наш способ проявить солидарность с актерами Купаловского театра.</description>

      <description>With love to Alvar and Aino
This apartment in a new suburb of Minsk was designed for a young couple who wanted to create a living space filled with light and warmth. For inspiration, we turned to the works of two Finnish architects: Alvar and Aino Aalto. What set them apart from the cold and uncompromising architecture of their time was the search for materials and techniques that help create a more human space.</description>

      <description>Grey apartment
The apartment is located on the ground floor of a two-storey Stalin-era residential building in the centre of Minsk. The space initially comprised a very compact bedroom and living room, a small kitchen and a narrow corridor. Our client planned to live there alone and he wanted a universal design without reference to a particular style or historical period. According to the redesigned layout, the kitchen and the living room were united into a single bright space, creating strong visual connection with the hallway.</description>

      <description>Minsk Light Industry Accessory Factory. Facade renovation
The building of a former accessories factory is located in the central part of Minsk and dates back to the second half of the 20th century. It is a typical example of functionalism in soviet architecture.
The new owner wanted to transform the empty building into a business hub where IT-companies coexist with educational establishments and cultural institutions. We were asked to adapt the run-down facades for the new function.</description>

Entry for A-100 sculpture competition “Unity in Diversity”
In November 2020, Minsk neighborhood New Bor suffered water and heating cuts attributed to vandalism. For several days people from all over the city were delivering bottles of water and portable radiators in a show of solidarity. The event brought together complete strangers in their desire to help fellow citizens. This phenomenal unity and self-organization must never be forgotten.</description>

      <description>Coffee shop in Minsk
There are coffee shops where you feel at home. Their design is not saturated with colour, wallpaper patterns, complex material combinations, heavy décor. They&amp;rsquo;re simple places, where it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have breakfast any day of the week. Their most important thing is the smell of coffee and freshly baked goods, an atmospheric playlist and lots of familiar faces. The space itself is just a backdrop.
The coffee house is located in an old flat in the Osmolovka district.</description>

      <description>Marx. Bookstore and coffee shop
The concept of the project is based on the idea of combining a bookstore, a coffee shop and a small art gallery in a single space. Divided into two parts by a massive wall, the space along Marx Street organically accommodates these functions. The integrity of the space is ensured by two wide portals in the wall and a uniform layout. We tried to avoid the usual &amp;lsquo;catering&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;shop&amp;rsquo; typologies and instead create an informal, friendly atmosphere with free-standing armchairs and small light tables.</description>

      <description>Eternal peace
Since childhood I have regularly visited cemeteries. Of all the reasons to be there, funeral is by far the least common. In Belarus people visit cemeteries on religious holidays, but also for important family celebrations. At the cemetery they clean the graves of their relatives together, they introduce the new family members to the old, they remember their departed loved ones, finally they can talk and share a humble meal.</description>

      <description>Knomary office
The starting point for our design was the initially complex configuration of the space, the wide range of wall materials, variations in ceiling height and floor level. To create a comfortable environment, we decided to tie the existing surfaces together with a common light grey colour, against which the black pavilion with private offices and a call booth stands out. This way we were free to introduce a variety of complementary materials and shapes of furniture: stainless steel, light wood, red textile.</description>

      <description>“Touchable distance” Exhibition design
The unequivocal times we’re currently facing have entailed an abrupt change in the ways we interact with each other, and our perception of the surrounding world. This shift in our form of communication has not only led to societal frustration, but also pushed us to rethink familiar concepts. Daily life and human behavior have significantly changed with a sense of increased fear and anxiety. Breaking away from our physical connections, in the most basic sense, we are forced to seek interaction online.</description>

      <description>Melancholy space
Melancholy is a form of mental illness manifested in a prolonged state of sadness. Characteristic for melancholy is a solemn and pensive mood, often the result of a more thoughtful view on life. In small doses it is a defence reaction of the psyche, a restorative slumber bringing rebirth.
Postmodernism created an environment brimming with signs and meanings. This obscures the distinction between essential and secondary. An apartment leaves you alone with yourself, lets you escape the belarusian reality.</description>

      <description>Labor and leisure club
Located in Minsk and built around the 1950s, the building represents a typical example of soviet architecture. To include it in the modern economical and cultural contexts while preserving its architectural identity was the leading motive of the project.
The building is a legacy of the soviet industrial architecture of the mid 20th century. The combination of red walls with white window frames and decor was one of the characteristic features of industrial buildings of that time.</description>

Concept for the development of the former Experimental Plant of Technological Equipment in Minsk
The development of decayed industrial sites is a key factor in the renewal of Minsk. Tucked away amid residential quarters, such territories are often more viable than specially designed public spaces. Despite its enclosed nature and isolation from the streets, the Experimental Plant of Technological Equipment too has the potential to become a full-fledged and successful place.</description>

      <description>Useless tree
At one time Alexander Brodsky used to take photos of old garages, while John Pawson - of the sky. Both saw in it architectural value, albeit this value was personal. Perhaps if one wants to learn how to create simple and comprehensible design, first one has to learn to see beauty in the mundane, to understand the nature of these simple things: how the owners of those garages adapted the standard soviet structure to their needs or how atmospheric pollution in different regions changes the colour of sky.</description>
