      <description>White candle holder

A big enveloping cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s bigger than a normal chair: its dimensions defy common standards. You don&amp;rsquo;t sit on this chair, you stay in it. Furthermore, sitting in the chair is just one of the possible poses. Its soft, rounded shape gives it a relaxed and stable character. The upholstery is made of white textured corduroy.
The chair is inspired by the works of the French studio Pierre Augustin Rose and the Russian designer Olga Engel.</description>

The chair is on the border between a functional object and a sculpture. It was specifically designed to stand out in the interior. It has no backrest, making it more of a cushioned stool. The armrests flow smoothly from the shape of the seat. The solid base gives the entire structure stability. The distinctive shape is accentuated by the black velour upholstery.
The chair is inspired by the works of the French studio Pierre Augustin Rose and the Russian designer Olga Engel.</description>
